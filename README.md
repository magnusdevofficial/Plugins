# SpigotMC.org and Bukkit.org Plugins

Hello, welcome to my GitHub! This is the place where many of my new resources posted on Bukkit and SpigotMC are being open-source released.

# Important:
All of my plugin source-code are for educational purposes only, using my source-code for commercial use will result in the plugin being removed from GitHub and the people wanting to learn will be the ones that will get effected by that.

So please, do something nice for the community and do not use this for commerical things, only for **learning purposes**. Have fun learning!

Have a super duper nice day! 
Kind regards, MagnusDev
